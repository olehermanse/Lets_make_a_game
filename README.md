[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/olehermanse/sim_game.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/olehermanse/sim_game)

## Installation
### Windows
Multiple installations/versions of python can be very troublesome on windows. If you don't know what you're doing, uninstall all other versions of python. Otherwise, always make sure you are using the correct installation of python AND pip.

Recommended Python version 3.5, 64 bit from:
https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/

Download pre-built libraries(wheels) from this site:
http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/

If python, pip and ensurepip are all up to date, all you have to do is download the wheel file and:
```
pip3 install filename.whl
```

Example:
```
pip3 install .\pygame-1.9.2-cp35-cp35m-win_amd64.whl
```
